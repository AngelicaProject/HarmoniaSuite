# Harmonia installer core

Phase 2 provides the shared Rust foundation for future install, repair and update commands. It is
currently a library crate; no installer UI, OS registration, rolling Git/build pipeline or self-update
helper is included yet.

The core owns:

- Windows/Linux per-user application and user-data path resolution;
- atomic installation state and transaction journal writes;
- exclusive installation locking;
- persistent structured diagnostics;
- HTTPS download abstraction with retries, `.partial` resume, mandatory SHA-256 checks and
  `Content-Range` validation before append;
- shell-free process execution with process-tree timeout termination, bounded output capture,
  explicit environment policy and redacted command diagnostics;
- validated transaction phases and conservative crash-recovery inspection.

Run the checks from the repository root with:

```text
cargo fmt --check --manifest-path apps/installer/Cargo.toml
cargo clippy --manifest-path apps/installer/Cargo.toml --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test --manifest-path apps/installer/Cargo.toml
cargo build --release --manifest-path apps/installer/Cargo.toml
```
